# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

## Implementation using Support Vector Machine

Reached highest accuracy at **89%** and average accuracy at **82%** with 10-Fold Cross Validation

## An Implementation using Convolutional Neural Networks

Reached highest accuracy at **84%**

## To Do:
- Do another feature engineering. Any classifier no longer able to upgrade the accuracy.
